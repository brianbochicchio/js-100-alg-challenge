# js-100-alg-challenge
My code from 100 Algorithm Challenge video course

A collection of challenge code reponses to the video course - 100 JavaScript Algorithm Challenges on Packt. Which the author, interestingly wants you to do in TypeScript. ;)

My answers won't always line up with the author's solution in the video. I will also try to improve upon the answer by making it more optimized or add capabilites to make it more flexible. These will be noted in the comments.
