# js-100-alg-challenge
My code from 100 Algorithm Challenge video course

A simple collection of challenge code reponses from the video course - 100 JavaScript Algorithm Challenges on Packt. Which the author, interestingly wants you to do in TypeScript. ;)
My answers won't always line up with the author's and I will sometimes try and improve on the final result.  Be sure to scan the comments at the top of the file for more abot this.
